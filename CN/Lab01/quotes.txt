The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.
There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.
Society has only those	criminals it deserves to have.
Problems are seldom as	bad as they seem at first sight.
Life is either	a daring adventure or nothing.
It is better to have loved and lost than just to have lost.
It is bad luck to be superstitious.
Always remember that you are unique. Just like everyone else.
